# Happy Thoughts Project ðŸ’Œ

In this week's project, I built a website in React. Which enables users to post their happy thoughts, this data is posted to an API. The focus was useStates to determine when and what will happen when the components are mounted. 

## The built and challanges

âœ…The page fetched data from 2 different API endpoints. One that fetches all the data from the API displayed as a list of messages on the page. Another one that react sto the amount of liked messages. 
âœ…When the users enter and sends a new message, it posts directly onto the API and will be displayed on the page 
âœ…The page shows all the recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
âœ…The thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
âœ… It contains a form to post new thoughts
âœ…the heart button was implemented to send likes on a thought
âœ…Tin the input, there is a count below the form that updates as the user types and shows how many characters are remaining. Make it go red when the user has typed over 140 characters.
âœ…CSS animation and styling was added

The Challanges included Send a POST request with a JSON body. And to truly understand what is happens here. Further to then use components in a structured way, and using props to feed information between the components in a nice way. Another challange was to understand and find out: how to   send a POST request (with no body) to a new URL when user clicks the heart button on a thought.This I beleive will take some more time to fully graspðŸ¤¯. I have used youtube this time a lot trying to graps the different theoretical and pratical concepts of Props and useStates and useEffect.
